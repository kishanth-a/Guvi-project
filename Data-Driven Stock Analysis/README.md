# Data-Driven Stock Analysis

## Project Overview
The **Data-Driven Stock Analysis** project provides a comprehensive visualization and analysis of Nifty 50 stocks' performance over the past year. This end-to-end data analysis project involves extracting, cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing stock data using tools like Python, Power BI, and Streamlit. It is designed to help investors, analysts, and enthusiasts make informed decisions based on stock performance trends.

## Features
- **Stock Performance Ranking**: Identify the top 10 best-performing stocks (green stocks) and the top 10 worst-performing stocks (red stocks).
- **Market Overview**: Summarize the overall market performance, including green vs. red stock ratios and average metrics.
- **Volatility Analysis**: Evaluate stock risk by calculating the standard deviation of daily returns.
- **Cumulative Return**: Visualize overall performance growth with cumulative return trends.
- **Sector-Wise Analysis**: Analyze performance by sector to gauge market sentiment in industries like IT, Financials, and Energy.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Display relationships between stock prices with a correlation heatmap.
- **Monthly Insights**: Showcase top 5 gainers and losers on a monthly basis.
